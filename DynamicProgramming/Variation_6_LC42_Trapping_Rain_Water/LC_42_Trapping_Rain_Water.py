#Solution Logic
'''
We define `left[i]` as the height of the highest bar to the left of and including the position at index `i`, 
and `right[i]` as the height of the highest bar to the right of and including the position at index `i`. 
Therefore, the amount of rainwater that can be trapped at index `i` is `min(left[i],right[i])-height[i]`. 
We traverse the array to calculate `left[i]` and `right[i]`, and the final answer is 

n-1
âˆ‘  min( left[i], right[i] ) - height[i]
i=0

The time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n). Here, n is the length of the array.

'''
In python `~i` is equivalent to `-1-i`.
We can iterate over the list `height` from the end to the beginning


`~i` is used to access elements from the end of the list r in reverse order.
`~(i - 1)` allows us to correctly reference the previous element in the list when iterating in reverse.
