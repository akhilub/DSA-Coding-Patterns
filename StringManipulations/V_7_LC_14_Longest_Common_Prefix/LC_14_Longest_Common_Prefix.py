#Approach: Two Pointers Traversal

'''
Character Comparison

We use the first string `strs[0]` as a benchmark, and compare whether the 
`i-th` character of the subsequent strings is the same as the `i-th` character of `strs[0]`. 

â€¢If they are the same, we continue to compare the next character. Otherwise, we return the first `i` characters of `strs[0]`.

â€¢If the traversal ends, it means that the first `i` characters of all strings are the same, and we return strs[0].

The time complexity is O(n x m), where m are the length of the string array and the minimum length of the strings, respectively. 
The space complexity is O(1).
