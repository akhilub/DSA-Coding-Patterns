#Approach : BFS Graph Traversal

# CLONE A GRAPH USING BREADTH FIRST SEARCH ALGORITHM
# A Graph is a collections of vertices and edges and can be noted G = (V,E) 


# we can use Breadth First Search Algorithm to traverse a Graph. And we can clone/copy a Node while we are visiting a Node in the first time, 
#and also we need to copy the edge i.e. add the neighbour nodes to the current nodesâ€™ neighbour list.

# We use a queue to implement a Breadth First Search Algorithm.
