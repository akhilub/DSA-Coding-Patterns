**[Problem Statement](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/3593060/maximum-and-minimum-element-in-an-array/2696489)**


Given an integer array nums of size n, find the maximum and minimum elements in the array and return them as a pair.

Write a function findMinMax that takes in an integer array nums and returns a pair of integers containing the maximum and minimum elements.


You can assume that nums will always have at least one element.

**Input:**


- An integer array nums of size n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) where each element is an integer (-10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9).

**Output:**


- Return an integer array containing two elements: the maximum element followed by the minimum element from nums.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [4, 2, 5, 1, 6, 3]
Output: [6, 1]
Explanation: The maximum element is 6, and the minimum element is 1.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1, 5, 7, 2, 9, 3]
Output: [9, 1]
Explanation: The maximum element is 9, and the minimum element is 1.
```
