> ## Problem Statement

You are given a two-dimensional list of integers edges which represents a directed, weighted graph. Each element in edges contains [u, v, w] meaning that there is an edge from node u to node v which costs positive weight w. You are also given integers start and end.

Return the cost of the shortest path from start to end. If there is no path between the two nodes, return -1.

**Constraints**
`1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000` 
where n is the length of edges

Example 1

```
Input:

edges = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2, 2],
    [0, 2, 9]
]
start = 0
end = 2
Output :5

Explanation
We can go 0 to 1 for cost of 3 and then 1 to 2 for cost of 2.
```
