# Binary Search Tree

- A binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.


## Defination 

L<N<R

Input : [2,1,3,0,1.5,2.5,4]

```
               2
            /     \
          1        3
        /  \      /  \
       0   1.5   2.5  4
```

In a BST 


### preorder traversal    i.e NLR   

### inorder traversal     i.e LNR  0,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,4
- gives elements in sorted order from smallest to largest

### postorder traversal   i.e RLN

### reverseInorder traversal i.e RNL 4,3,2.5,2,1.5,1
- gives elements in reverse sorted order from largest to smallest
