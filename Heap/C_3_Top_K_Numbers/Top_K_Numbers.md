# Top 'K' Numbers

Problem Statement
Given an unsorted array of numbers, find the ‘K’ largest numbers in it.

Example 1:

Input: [3, 1, 5, 12, 2, 11], K = 3
Output: [5, 12, 11]
Example 2:

Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
Output: [12, 11, 12]

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
