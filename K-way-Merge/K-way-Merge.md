# K-Way Merge

- The k-way merge coding pattern is a technique used to merge k-sorted arrays or lists into a single sorted array or list.
- This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets or streams of data that are already sorted and need to be combined efficiently. 
- The k-way merge algorithm minimizes the number of comparisons needed to merge all
the lists, resulting in improved time complexity.

## Here's a step-by-step explanation of the K-way merge coding pattern:

1. **Initialize Priority Queue or Heap:** Begin by initializing a priority queue or heap data structure. This data structure will be used to keep track of the current smallest elements from each of the k-sorted lists.

2. **Insert Initial Elements:** Insert the first element from each of the k-sorted lists into the priority queue or heap. This step ensures that the smallest elements from
each list are available for comparison and merging.

3. **Iterative Comparison and Merging:**
    - While the priority queue or heap is not empty:
    - Remove the smallest element from the priority queue or heap. This element will be the next in the merged list.
    - Insert the next element from the same list from which the smallest element was removed, if available.
    - Repeat this process until all elements from all lists have been merged.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:** If any of the sorted lists still have remaining elements after the iterative merging process, simply append them to the merged list. Since the input lists are already sorted, no additional sorting is required.

5. **Return Merged List:** Once all elements have been merged, return the final merged list containing all elements from the input lists in sorted order.
