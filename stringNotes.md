# Consider a string of n characters: ""

 - No of substring = C(n,2) + C(n,1) = n(n+1)/2
   C(n,2) - because substring contains more than one character
   C(n,1) - because one character in itself is a substring


- A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
