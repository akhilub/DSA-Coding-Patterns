- Greedy algorithm is used to solve problems in which the best choice is made at each step and it finds a solution at minimal step.This approach assumes that choosing a local optimum at each stage lead to will lead to determination of global optimum.

# Greedy Process
1. Start with an empty solution set
2. Iterative Item Selection 
3. Add item to Solution Set 
4. Feasibility Check
5. Accept or reject the item
6. Repeat Until Complete
7. Assess Final Solution
